### 1. Download Julia **[from the official website](https://julialang.org/downloads/)** and install it with the standard settings.

### 2. Start Julia (e.g. in the Windows Start Menu). 
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    The Julia REPL (a black window) will appear. Please keep this window open until you are done with the simulation.
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.html path="assets/img/julia-repl.png" title="julia repl" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div> 
:   

### 3. Copy the code below. 
```
begin
  # Download the notebook into a temporary directory
  nb = download("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frankhuettner/newsvendor/main/game/newsvendorgame.jl", joinpath(mktempdir(), "newsvendorsimulation.jl"))
  # Install Pluto
  import Pkg;	Pkg.add("Pluto")
  # Start Pluto and load the notebook
  import Pluto; Pluto.run(dismiss_update_notification=true, notebook=nb)
end
 ```


### 4. Paste the code into the Julia REPL 
   <div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
       <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
       **Rightclick into the Julia REPL window. This will insert** the code that you copied above (Ctrl+V will not work). Hit the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to execute the code.

       </div>
       <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
       {% include figure.html path="assets/img/julia-repl-pasted.png" title="julia repl code inserted" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
       </div>
   </div> 
   
### 5. Now wait for 10 minutes. 
Julia will install Pluto and download the simulation. 
**After about 5 minutes, it opens your browser** and you see fragments of the simulation. It will install further packages and is finished once the animations stop. Get a ‚òï or üçµ or use your computer for something else while waiting (*do **not** close the Julia window*).

### 6. Play the game and download your score when you finished the game.
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/screenshot_download.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    When you're done (make sure having downloaded your score), you can close of Julia and the browser window.
